

This is a complete collection of all of the commercial, freeware, and various 
"type-in BASIC Listings" for the Video Technology VZ200 & VZ300 / Laser210 & 
Laser310 Computers.

This is a LIVE archive file, that will be continuously (but slowly) updated. 
Probably up until I die.

The file format that is within is mostly in the ".VZ" snapshot file format. 
This is the most common format for the VZ.
From a .VZ file, there are Windows .EXE conversion utilities under \utils to 
convert this is a standard PCM ".WAV" file that will then load into a real 
physical VZ computer, using wither your phone, MP3 player on your computer 
or a physical old-school tape player.

The other file format that is included is the VZ Floppy Disk Drive image file 
format ".DSK" that is used by the VZEM emulator, and ".DVZ" which is used by
Gavin Turners WinDSEVZ200 emulator. 
Various software is loaded on these disk images.

There are a number of readme.txt files, a handful of JPG images, and one .WAV 
file included in this .ZIP file. 
The best demo ever produced for the VZ, named "2018AD", is the one .WAV file
to enable you to physically load it into a 4k Laser210 / 6k VZ200.
It may or may not work correctly on the VZ300 due to timing differences.



Shout out to all of the VZ community out there.
Hit us all up on "VZ200 FANS" group on Facebook.



Do you have a bit of software for the VZ? Send it to me and get creds!

Dave.
